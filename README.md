This was my technical high school capstone project **(TCC)** : a wireless price tag system for supermarket shelves. The solution uses an **ESP8266 microcontroller** with Wi-Fi connectivity, a mini **OLED display** to show product prices, and **MongoDB** as the database. The project demonstrates a low-cost, scalable alternative to traditional price labeling through IoT integration.
