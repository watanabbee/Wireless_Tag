This project was my technical high school capstone **(TCC)**, focused on developing a wireless price tag system for supermarket shelves. It uses the **ESP8266 microcontroller** for Wi-Fi communication and **MongoDB** as the database. The goal was to create a low-cost, remotely updatable electronic labeling system for modern retail environments.
